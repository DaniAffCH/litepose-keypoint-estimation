# LitePose keypoint estimation

LitePose is an efficient and scale invariant Pose Estimation model. Its light architecture allows to perform real-time inference with low computational power devices such as smartphones. This is a reimplementation of the original [LitePose paper][1].

## How does it work?

This work is based on [LitePose][2] paper and [HigherHRNet][3]. Moreover it uses the [Associative Embedding][4] to cluster the keypoints.
